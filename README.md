# AndroidApp-ReadExcelDataFromFile
A simple app which read data from excel file and can view that data in recycler view. the file is located at app/src/main/assets/mdata.xls
you can replace that file or you can even enable a feature to allow user to choose file and place that file as mdata.xls and can show that data 
on recycler view.

Note:
I have a model class named RuleRegulation, you have to create your custom class to support all excel files.
